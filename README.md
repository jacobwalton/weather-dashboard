# weather-dashboard
Utilizing JQuery, MomentJS, and OpenWeather API, I created a weather dashboard.
When the user searches a city, they are presented with that city's current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast.
The user's search is also added to a list of previous search.
When previous search input is clicked, the corresponding weather data is displayed again.
