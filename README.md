# weather-dashboard
I've created a weather dashboard which displays the current weather conditions of the desired city.

This weather dashboard keeps track of previous searches (as long as they're valid) and shows you a prints a list so the user can easily select which cities they've searched before

I added an "if" statement which will add an icon next to the name of the city if it's cold or hot.

The weather dashboard displays a 5 day forecast under the current weather display. 

Using momentjs, I was also able to print the current date as well as future dates used in the forecast.
